üëã Hi there! I‚Äôm voma Nwana, an aspiring data analyst with a passion for unravelling insights from complex datasets. My journey involves turning raw data into actionable knowledge, and I‚Äôm excited to share my projects and experiences. This GitHub repository showcases my projects across various tools and technologies. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas! --please add more info with your personal infromation --

## About Me üéì 

-- please update this part with your pitch --
I hold a degree in Biomedical Science and an MSc in Clinical Biochemistry, where I gained extensive hands-on experience in data analysis and interpretation and worked across different healthcare sector  with a focus on data analytics.Beyond my academic research, I pursued training in IT networking infrastructure enabling me to better understand the complexities of data management and analysis.My passion for precision and problem-solving drove me to expand my expertise by obtaining the ISEB-ISTQB Foundation Level Certificate in Software Testing required a high level of analytical thinking, attention to detail, and the ability to interpret and report on large datasets efficiently. 
I hold a degree in Biomedical Science and an MSc in Clinical Biochemistry, where I developed extensive hands-on experience in data analysis, statistical interpretation, and problem-solving. Throughout my academic research, I worked with large datasets, applying statistical methodologies and data visualisation techniques to identify trends, validate hypotheses, and drive evidence-based conclusions. My ability to extract meaningful insights from complex data has been instrumental in refining analytical models and improving decision-making.
Beyond academia, I expanded my expertise in IT networking infrastructure, strengthening my understanding of data architecture, management, and security‚Äîkey components in handling and analysing structured and unstructured data. Recognising the importance of precision and accuracy in data-driven environments, I further honed my analytical skills by obtaining the ISEB-ISTQB Foundation Level Certificate in Software Testing, where I gained experience in test planning, defect analysis, and data validation. This certification reinforced my ability to interpret large datasets, maintain data integrity, and ensure the reliability of data-driven systems.
With a strong foundation in data analysis, technical proficiency, and problem-solving skills, I am eager to apply my expertise in a data analytics role, where I can transform raw data into actionable insights that drive business success, enhance operational efficiency, and support strategic decision-making. My diverse background in scientific research, IT infrastructure, and software testing uniquely positions me to approach data challenges with a multifaceted perspective, making me a valuable asset to any data-driven organisation.

üìä Proficient in Excel, Tableau Power Bi, SQL, and good in python data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn) Postman. 
üß© Skilled in extracting dataset, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modelling, writing test cases,test scripts, manual testing, regression testing, requirement test traceability matrics. 
üåê Curious about web scraping and API integration. 

## Projects
1.:   The cytokines role in obesity-related insulin resistance contributes to developing type 2 diabetes: I utilised Excel extensively, employing advanced tools such as  scattered plot graphs to find correlation as well as using bar chart to measure quantities across catergories of cytokines and histograms for data visualisation, using statistical techniques to calculate key metrics including mean, mode, median, and range. This analytical process enabled me to identify patterns, test hypotheses, and make evidence-based arguments, fostering a strong ability to predict trends and derive actionable insights from data.
2:    The Impact of oxidative stress on Survivin Protein Expression in airway epithelial Cells. A projects involving the analysis and evaluation of complex datasets, both from my laboratory experiments and collaborative data shared by other labs.I utilised Excel extensively, employing advanced tools such as scatter plot graph to explore relashion between variables, bar chart and histograms for data visualisation, making it understandable, uncovering pattern, correlation, as well as statistical techniques to calculate key metrics including mean, mode, median, and range. and data-driven approach positions.
